# Final-Project-Preposal

1. For our final project we plan to make some type of game that involves rolling a dice. We would like to make it more of a board game style where you roll a dice in order to progress forward in hopes of reaching the finish line first. Maybe we could add some spots where you could go back to the start or skip a turn. 

2. I will be collaborating with Stephen Heckert.

3. As of now I don't have any questions that come to mind.
